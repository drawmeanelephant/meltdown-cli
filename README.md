# meltdown-cli

A CLI task manager for emotionally unstable developers.  
Because sometimes your to-do list should scream back.

## 🧠 Features

- 📌 Add tasks with randomized *existential dread* levels
- 🤬 Passive-aggressive commentary on everything you do
- 🧯 Crisis modes like `impostor`, `nihilist`, and `burnout`
- 📉 Dread-based productivity tracking
- 💀 Designed for burnout, procrastination, and sarcastic growth

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drawmeanelephant/meltdown-cli.git
cd meltdown-cli
npm install
```

## ⚙️ Usage

```bash
# Add a task
./index.js add "Write the README you’re currently reading"

# View your pile of shame
./index.js list

# Pretend you completed something
./index.js complete 1

# Monitor your emotional collapse
./index.js status
```

## 💥 Crisis Modes (coming soon)

Each mode injects specific mental sabotage:

- **Impostor**: Constant reminders you're a fraud
- **Nihilist**: Tells you it’s all meaningless (accurately)
- **Burnout**: Encourages self-sabotage via snarky neglect
