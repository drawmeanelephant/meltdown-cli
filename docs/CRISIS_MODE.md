# 🚨 CRISIS MODE: ACTIVATION MANUAL

> Because if your CLI isn’t screaming, are you even spiraling?

---

## 🧠 What is Crisis Mode?

Crisis Mode is meltdown-cli's highly unstable emotional state. Enabling it changes output tone, dread multipliers, and response verbosity to match the sensation of coding at 3AM while your career falls apart.

---

## 🔥 How to Enable

Just append `--crisis` to any command.

```bash
node index.js add "Write docs nobody reads" --crisis
```

---

## 🧷 What It Does

- Increases dread level automatically by +2 per task.
- Response tone becomes more *frantic*, *loud*, and *chaotic*.
- May include ASCII-based yelling.
- May override task titles with existential substitutes.

---

## 🤯 Sample Output

```bash
$ node index.js add "Clean up build scripts" --crisis
💀 TASK ADDED TO THE COLLAPSE QUEUE:
"Clean up build scripts" — upgraded to "Rebuild your self-worth through YAML"

$ node index.js status --crisis
📊 MELTDOWN SYSTEM IN CRISIS MODE
⚠️ TASK COUNT: 6
☠️ AVERAGE DREAD: 4.83/5
🧨 SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION: IMMINENT
```

---

## 🪓 Crisis Mode Design Philosophy

Built for:
- Devs too burned out for normal CLI behavior
- Late-stage projects with no future
- Coding while suppressing a panic attack

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Crisis Mode stacks with caffeine, imposter syndrome, and rapid context switching.
- Great for hackathons, end-of-sprint rewrites, and failing upwards.

---

## ⚠️ WARNING

Do not run in Crisis Mode unless you are prepared for:
- Passive-aggressive mascot interjections
- Meltdown data corruption (intentional, poetic)
- Terminal becoming a judgmental friend
