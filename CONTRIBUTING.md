# 🧨 CONTRIBUTING to meltdown-cli

Welcome, reckless coder. If you're here to contribute, it's either because you're emotionally unstable, terminally sarcastic, or just really into passive-aggressive CLIs. Excellent.

---

## 🧾 Expectations

- Your code should work, but more importantly, it should **mock the user**.
- Do not add positivity. This project thrives on bleakness.
- Every command should make the developer feel worse, not better.
- ASCII art is welcome, especially if it’s haunted.

---

## ✅ How to Contribute

1. Clone the repo and give up halfway.
2. Try again, but this time actually install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the CLI:
   ```bash
   node index.js add "Regret opening this PR"
   node index.js list
   node index.js complete 1
   node index.js status
   ```
4. Add your feature. Make sure it ridicules the user. For example:
   - Adds fake progress
   - Misinterprets input in funny ways
   - Uses dread metrics irresponsibly

5. Open a pull request. Use a commit message like:
   ```
   commit: make everything worse
   ```

## 🧷 Don'ts

- Don't write tests unless they shame the author when they fail.
- Don't use emojis unironically.
- Don’t be helpful.

---

## 🔥 Code Style

- Uses `commander` for CLI structure
- Uses flat `tasks.json` for storage
- Uses a pile of feelings and shame for logic
